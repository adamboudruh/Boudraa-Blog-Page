This might seem like just another regular season game, but guys, this could be a preview fo this years finals. The reigning champion nuggets have had a little underwhelming of a season so far but have exhibited more than enough instances of being able to flip that switch, lock in, and execute down the stretch like no other contender in the league. The boston celtics have seemed unbeatable all season, but the nuggets have disproven that by breaking through and sweeping the season series. This bodes very well for us nuggets fans!",
